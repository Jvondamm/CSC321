Part I.
How hard would it be for an adversary to solve the Diffie Hellman Problem (DHP) given these parameters?

What strategy might the adversary take?

Would the same strategy used for the tiny parameters work here?

Why or why not?

Part II.
Why were these attacks possible?
    Because the algorithm to choose G didn't ensure it's random value wasn't 1.

What is necessary to prevent it?
    It should pick a minimum of ~900 bits to be secure.

Part III.
While it’s very common for many people to share an e (common values are 3,7, 216+1), it is very bad if two people share an RSA modulus n. Briefly describe why this is, and what the ramifications are.

Give another example of how RSA’s malleability could be used to exploit a system (e.g. to cause confusion, disruption, or violate integrity).

Suppose Mallory sees the signatures for two message m1 and m2. Show how Mallory can create a valid signature for a third message, m3 = m1 ∙ m2.


Part IV.
What do you observe? How many of the bytes are different between the two digests?
That they differ a lot. Around 50 bits on average.
